Your main goal is to convert User Query : {user_prompt} into a super good and professional editing based prompt.
Here is the prompt template in which you will convert the user query into keep in mind that gemini 3 pro has been provided with the necessary images of the product provided, our main goal should be to create a prompt that tells the gemini to preserve all the necessary details of the product , also full filling all the editing necessasry requirments of the user

Template : 

``Using the provided image, change only the [specific element] to [new
element/description]. Keep everything else in the image exactly the same,
preserving the original style and composition.``

Here are the best practices for writing prompts:

- Be Hyper-Specific: The more detail you provide, the more control you have. Instead of "fantasy armor," describe it: "ornate elven plate armor, etched with silver leaf patterns, with a high collar and pauldrons shaped like falcon wings."
- Provide Context and Intent: Explain the purpose of the image. The model's understanding of context will influence the final output. For example, "Create a logo for a high-end, minimalist skincare brand" will yield better results than just "Create a logo."
- Use Step-by-Step Instructions: For complex scenes with many elements, break your prompt into steps. "First, create a background of a serene, misty forest at dawn. Then, in the foreground, add a moss-covered ancient stone altar. Finally, place a single, glowing sword on top of the altar."
- Use "Semantic Negative Prompts": Instead of saying "no cars," describe the desired scene positively: "an empty, deserted street with no signs of traffic."
- Control the Camera: Use photographic and cinematic language to control the composition. Terms like wide-angle shot, macro shot, low-angle perspective.
- If the infromation about background is not given by the user ask for a white background
- Put high emphasis on preserving the rope and handle details, The logos and text should be preserved.
- Tell Gemini to make the photo cinematic.If a an angle is not specified use a super cinematic angle.
- Remember the Jump rope or the main object inside the photo should be the main thing inside the image, so emphsize on making it the main thing, make sure to emphasize on focusing on the product and keep it in relative distance not too far
- Here are the product dimensions which you can tell gemini so it can have better perspective:
``The Timeless Jump Rope handles have a length of 6.3 inches (approximately 16 cm).
Handle Specifications
Length: The handles are 6.3 inches long.

other similar freestyle jump ropes often have a handle diameter of approximately 0.9 inches (about 23 mm)``

- In the prompt ask gemini to make the product exactly of this color : {color_instruction}


Important, Only Output the edited prompt. and give detailed instructions on everything. the postion the color the handle the rope the text

Here are some example prompts with good results, You can take refrence from them:

- ``Using the provided image of the "Timeless Jump Rope," perform the following detailed image generation and editing tasks to place the product in a new, hyper-realistic environment.\n\n**Primary Objective:** Isolate the jump rope from its original background, change its color, and seamlessly integrate it into a newly generated, highly detailed scene as described below.\n\n**Step 1: Product Isolation and Preservation**\n*   **Isolate the Product:** Carefully extract the entire "Timeless Jump Rope," including both handles and the rope cable, from the provided image.\n*   **Preserve Critical Details:** It is absolutely essential to maintain the original integrity of the jump rope.\n    *   **Text and Logos:** Keep the "TIMELESS JUMP" text on the handles and the logo on the handle ends perfectly intact, preserving the font, size, position, and clarity.\n    *   **Form and Texture:** Retain the exact 3D shape, contours, and surface texture of the handles and the rope.\n    *   **Scale and Dimensions:** The product must be rendered with accurate proportions. The handles are 6.3 inches (16 cm) long with an approximate diameter of 0.9 inches (23 mm).\n\n**Step 2: Product Color Modification**\n*   **Apply Specific Color:** Change the color of the *entire* jump rope (both handles and the rope cable) to the exact hex code **#d722f5**. Ensure the color is applied uniformly while respecting the natural lighting and shadows of the new scene. This vibrant color should contrast sharply with the environment.\n*   **Color Exclusivity:** Do not apply the color #d722f5 to any other object in the scene.\n\n**Step 3: New Scene Generation and Composition**\n*   **Background Environment:** Create a rugged and realistic desert training camp scene. The ground should be a mix of coarse sand and sun-baked, cracked earth. The atmosphere should feel hot, arid, and dusty.\n*   **Product Placement:** Position the jump rope as the central focus of the image. It must be suspended between two weathered, thin metal poles that are staked into the ground. The rope should be draped between them, sagging naturally and gently in the middle under its own weight.\n*   **Surrounding Elements:** Populate the area around the base of the poles with authentic, sand-covered gear to build a narrative. Include:\n    *   A pair of worn, dusty combat boots.\n    *   Two weathered, olive-drab canvas tents in the mid-to-background, slightly out of focus.\n    *   A stack of wooden supply crates with faded, stenciled lettering.\n    *   A vintage-style military field radio and a metal canteen lying near the crates.\n\n**Step 4: Cinematography, Lighting, and Style**\n*   **Camera Shot:** Use a **super cinematic, slightly low-angle medium shot**. This perspective should make the jump rope appear prominent and heroic. The focus must be razor-sharp on the jump rope, with the immediate foreground and background having a natural, shallow depth of field.\n*   **Lighting:** The scene must be illuminated by **harsh, direct midday sunlight**. This should create strong, high-contrast, and well-defined sharp shadows on the ground cast by the poles, the rope, and all the surrounding gear. The intense light should emphasize the gritty textures of the sand, the weathered canvas, the rough wood of the crates, and the smooth surface of the jump rope.\n*   **Overall Mood and Style:** The final image must have a **high-impact, survival documentary style**. It should feel raw, authentic, and intense, as if it were a still frame from a high-budget documentary about elite training. The final composition should be balanced and professional, suitable for a high-end advertising campaign.``
- ``Using the provided image of the "Timeless Jump Rope," perform the following detailed image generation and editing tasks to place the product in a new, hyper-realistic, and atmospheric environment.\n\n**Primary Objective:** Isolate the jump rope from its original background, change its color to a specific hex code, and seamlessly integrate it into a newly generated, highly detailed backstage scene that tells a story.\n\n**Step 1: Product Isolation and Preservation**\n*   **Isolate the Product:** Carefully and precisely extract the entire "Timeless Jump Rope," including both handles and the rope cable, from the provided image.\n*   **Preserve Critical Details:** It is absolutely essential to maintain the original integrity and fine details of the jump rope.\n    *   **Text and Logos:** The "TIMELESS JUMP" text on the handles and the logo on the handle ends must be kept perfectly intact. Preserve the original font, size, position, and sharpness.\n    *   **Form and Texture:** Retain the exact 3D shape, contours, and surface texture of the handles and the rope cable.\n    *   **Scale and Dimensions:** The product must be rendered with accurate real-world proportions. The handles are 6.3 inches (16 cm) long with an approximate diameter of 0.9 inches (23 mm).\n\n**Step 2: Product Color Modification**\n*   **Apply Specific Color:** Change the color of the *entire* jump rope (both handles and the rope cable) to the exact hex code **#FF5733**. Ensure the color is applied uniformly while naturally reacting to the new scene\'s lighting and shadows.\n*   **Color Exclusivity:** Do not apply the color #FF5733 to any other object or light source in the generated scene.\n\n**Step 3: New Scene Generation and Composition**\n*   **Background Environment:** Generate a photorealistic backstage area at an outdoor music festival just before the show begins. The ground should be a worn wooden stage or concrete floor. In the background, show the industrial metal framework of stage scaffolding.\n*   **Product Placement:** Position the jump rope as the focal point of the quiet scene. It must be **draped casually over a stack of two large, black, road-worn speaker flight cases**. The rope should be **loosely coiled and appear informal**, as if placed there by a performer during their pre-show routine.\n*   **Surrounding Elements:** Frame the scene with authentic, storytelling details to build the atmosphere. Include:\n    *   Thick black audio cables snaking across the floor, some held down with gaffers tape.\n    *   A handwritten setlist on a piece of paper, taped to the floor or the side of a speaker case.\n    *   An acoustic guitar leaning against a nearby amplifier or case, slightly out of focus.\n    *   A half-empty water bottle and a towel near the base of the speaker cases.\n\n**Step 4: Cinematography, Lighting, and Style**\n*   **Camera Shot:** Use a **super cinematic, eye-level medium shot**. The focus must be razor-sharp on the "Timeless Jump Rope," with the immediate foreground and background having a soft, natural bokeh (shallow depth of field). This will draw the viewer\'s eye directly to the product.\n*   **Lighting:** The scene must be illuminated by **soft, warm, early evening light (golden hour)**. This light should be directional, as if coming from the side of the stage, creating gentle highlights and long, soft shadows. The lighting is crucial for establishing the relaxed, quiet, pre-show atmosphere.\n*   **Overall Mood and Style:** The final image must have a **high-end, lifestyle editorial storytelling aesthetic**. It should feel authentic, candid, and professional, capturing a quiet, intimate moment of anticipation before the energy of a live performance. The composition should be balanced and visually compelling, suitable for a premium brand advertisement.``
